short explanation:
[+] string contcatenates of the string that starts in si to the string
[+] that starts in di

detailed explanation:
[+] in label1 we move di into the end of the string meaning the '\0' char
[+] skip through all the characters before
[+] in label2 we move character by character from si position to the di position
[+] meaning copy the string on si to the end of the string in di
