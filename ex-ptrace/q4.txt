I got the pid of the antivirus using the 'ps aux' and filtering the pid
[+] and I made a program in C and compiled it beforehand with a global pid
[+] in order to do binary patching from the server to the pid of the antivirus
[+] and inside the C program I used ptrace in order to attach, then stop the
[+] antivirus before and after each syscall and if the antivirus stoped before
[+] 'read' syscall aka eax is 3 then patch the edx that represents length into 0
[+] in order for the antivirus to not read our malware and therefore
[+] not get his hash
[+] In order to make an evasion that prevent from the antivirus to catch our
[+] malware
