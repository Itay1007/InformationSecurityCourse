I got the pid of the antivirus using the 'ps aux' and filtering the pid
[+] also before the running of the server I found the CHECK_IF_VIRUS_CODE
[+] address of the function 'check_if_virus' and I 
[+] made a program in C and compiled it beforehand with a global pid
[+] in order to do binary patching from the server to the pid of the antivirus
[+] and inside the C program I used ptrace in order to attach, then change
[+] the opcodes in the start of the function that checks the virus to
[+] 'mov eax, 0; ret'
[+] In order to make an evasion that prevent from the antivirus to catch our
[+] malware
