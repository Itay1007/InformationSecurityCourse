In oreder to implement this evasion 
[+] I killed the anditvirus program
[+] First, I found its procees identifier using the "ps aux"
[+] command from the server that displays processes metadata like pid
[+] and then I implemented the handler function that gets
[+] the recieved output of the command from the malware
[+] so that for each line I checked if the antivirus program is the process
[+] and if so I splitted and took the pid
[+] else I returned -1
[+] If it was -1 then no antivirus program found and else
[+] I called the evasion function that sends another command from the server
[+] of f"kill -9 {pid}" that forces a kill of the antivirus program
