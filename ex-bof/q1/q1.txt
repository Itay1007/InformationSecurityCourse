I want to do an authentication bypass in order to be able to execute anyshell-command that I want as root because of the suid bit is up in this vulnerable binary.
I found an exploitable vulnerability of using the known vulnerable strcat together with
[+] an off-by-one in the concatinate of the passowrd that I control to buffer
[+] This allowed me to control the value of auth
[+] I crafted my payload to make the auth equal to 1 using objdump, ida and dgb
[+] to bypass the authentication and add my user to sudo group!
[+] payload: ./sudo `python3 -c 'print("A" * 9 +chr(1))'` "/usr/sbin/adduser user sudo"
