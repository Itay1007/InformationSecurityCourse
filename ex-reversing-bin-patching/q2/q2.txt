In the long deadlock I did a first jump to the fgets in order to get the 
[+] first line and than in the other deadlock I jumped to the first
[+] and there I checked the 2 leading bytes if they are not "#!" which is the
[+] subeng line I returned to before the printf execution and if the line starts
[+] "#!" I moved the string pointer to the next char after them and I called to
[+] system which was included in the file with the remaining string and then I
[+] jumped to the end of the printf
[+] I managed to do in each iteration a check for sebang line and if found
[+] then execution of the command in system instead of the print of the line
