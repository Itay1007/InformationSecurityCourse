Calculation of the score function based on this:
    [+] Took the <plaintext> and for each character checked if it is
    [+] a standart character that is likely to appear in a human readable sentence
    [+] which is: digit, alpha or a space
    [+] incremented by 1 the counter if this indeed the case
    
Why this represents:
    [+] returned the counter that represents the score for this string to 
    [+] be a human readable sentense as the number of characters in the string
    [+] that are able to be in a sentence
    [+] it is logical because a real sentence will get a really high
    [+] score for his lenght because his chars are valid 
    [+] while not all the chars in a random string from the same length
    [+] likely to not be from the characters in a human readble sentence
