I did brute force on each byto by itself of the key
[+] so that it will be quick because it is only 2 ** 8 options
[+] multiplied by min(len(cipher), key_length) \\ 8 + 1
[+] fast from one side and well from the other becuase
[+] the xor on the bytes in xor cipher_byte vs key_byte
[+] so there is no dependencies between different XORs of bytes
[+] took the score by suming the score of all the bytes in the cipher that use
[+] this byte for xor because it is more  accurate
