In order to make the ascii shell code I did a buffer overflow crafted
[+] nop silde then ascii code to find the start of the ascii shellcode to eax
[+] then the decoder that xors 0xff of the bytes that encoded with xor of 0xff
[+] which works because the xor 0xff flips all the bits to the sum of
[+] encode(x) + x = 0xff while x >= 0x80 and thus encode(x) <= 0x80
[+] besides I saved the indices that I changed in order to do decode over in run time
[+] after the decoder decoded the ascii shellcode into the real code
[+] the ascii shellcode executed means I created a socket and connected to
[+] the C&C Server then duplicated the file descriptor of the socket into
[+] STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR and executed the bash on the server
[+] GOT a remote shell on the server that is controlled by the C&C Server
