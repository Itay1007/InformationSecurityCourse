I used the buffer overflow vulnerability that I found
[+] in order to create a remote shell execution
[+] First I created a socket and connected back to my Command and Control Server
[+] Then I duplicated the STDIN, STDOUT, STDEE, with the  socket file descriptor
[+] Such that I will get from the connection data as STDIN and send to the
[+] connection data as STDOUT and STDERR
[+] Finally I called execute without environment aka exev to open a bash shell
[+] on the server
[+] I did a reverse shell and got a remote shell that is controlled by the C&C Server
