the goal is brute force on a small number
[+] the PIN is a numebr between 0000-9999
[+] we can brute force it and get the encryption of each one
[+] because the encryption is a oen to one function as you need to be able
[+] to decrypt for the message then we know that by comparing the ciphers
[+] that we get each to the argument we will found an equation and
[+] than can return the PIN that resulted the equation
