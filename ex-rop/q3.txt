I used padding before the rop chain that started with the override of the 
[+] return address
[+] Got the patched value, then the address to patch and then patched this address
[+] I implemented 'mov eax, PATCHED_AUTH' WRITE gadget using
[+] 'pop eax; ret' which is the POP gadget and before on the stack 
[+] I added addresses.address_to_bytes(PATCHED_AUTH)
[+] Then I implemented 'mov edi, addresses.AUTH' WRITE gadget using
[+] 'pop eax; ret' which is the POP gadget and before on the stack 
[+] I added addresses.AUTH
[+] In order to override the auth variable I used the gadget of STOSD
[+] 'stosd; ret'
